# Explanation
I created this program to research how to make two devices communicate and work together. You MUST be on the same network.

Here are the different commands available at the moment.
view_cwd: Gets the path to the folder where the client file is located on the device.
custom_dir: Allows you to get the list of files with a path to a desired folder.
exit: makes you quit the program.
